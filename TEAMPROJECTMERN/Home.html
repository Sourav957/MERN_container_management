    <div>History Of The Docker----</div>
    <p>
        Founded as DotCloud in 2008 by Solomon Hykes in Paris, what we now know as Docker started out as a platform as a service (PaaS) before pivoting in 2013 to focus on democratizing the underlying software containers its platform was running on.

        Hykes first demoed Docker at PyCon in March 2013, where he explained that Docker was created because developers kept asking for the underlying technology powering the DotCloud platform. “We did always think it would be cool to be able to say, ‘Yes, here is our low-level piece. Now you can do Linux containers with us and go do whatever you want, go build your platform.’ So that’s what we are doing.”

        And so Docker was born, with the open source project quickly picking up traction with developers and attracting the attention of high-profile technology providers like Microsoft, IBM, and Red Hat, as well as venture capitalists willing to pump millions of dollars into the innovative startup. The container revolution had begun.

        What is Docker----
    </div>

    <p>
        Docker is an open source containerization platform. It enables developers to package applications into containers—standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment. Containers simplify delivery of distributed applications, and have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments.

        Developers can create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy and manage containers. Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands and work-saving automation through a single API.

        Why We Need Docker----
    </div>
    <p>
        Docker is so popular today that “Docker” and “containers” are used interchangeably. But the first container-related technologies were available for years — even decades (link resides outside IBM) — before Docker was released to the public in 2013. <br>
        Most notably, in 2008, LinuXContainers (LXC) was implemented in the Linux kernel, fully enabling virtualization for a single instance of Linux. While LXC is still used today, newer technologies using the Linux kernel are available. Ubuntu, a modern, open-source Linux operating system, also provides this capability. <br>
        <br>
        Docker enhanced the native Linux containerization capabilities with technologies that enable: 
        <div id="span_work">
        <span>-Improved—and seamless—portability:</span>While LXC containers often reference machine-specific configurations, Docker containers run without modification across any desktop, data center and cloud environment. <br><br>
        <span>-Even lighter weight and more granular updates:</span> With LXC, multiple processes can be combined within a single container. With Docker containers, only one process can run in each container. This makes it possible to build an application that can continue running while one of its parts is taken down for an update or repair. <br><br>
        <span>-Automated container creation:</span> Docker can automatically build a container based on application source code. <br><br>
        <span>-Container versioning:</span> Docker can track versions of a container image, roll back to previous versions, and trace who built a version and how. It can even upload only the deltas between an existing version and a new one. <br><br>
        <span>-reuse:</span> Existing containers can be used as base images—essentially like templates for building new containers. <br><br>
        <span>-Shared container libraries:</span> Developers can access an open-source registry containing thousands of user-contributed containers. <br><br>
